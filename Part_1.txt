Question 1
**********
3 perceptrons.
XOR = NAND * OR; note: * = AND
They are connected in a way that it is a fully connceted Neural Network with 2 neurons at the hidden layer and one at the output. The two hidden layer neurons are trained to be NAND and OR gates. And the output layer neuron is a AND.

NAND ---------> AND------->Output
OR --------------^

Question 2
**********
I only trained the NAND and OR gate because the AND = !NAND so I added an
invert() function that inverts the weights of the perceptrons.
For each perceptron I passed the same set of inputs twice. There are only 4 combinations you can make from two inputs so I trained the algorithm with 8 inputs.
4 inputs were too few and giving wrong results. The training data can be found in training.hpp file.
